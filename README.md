# Sentiment Analysis of Samsung’s Galaxy and Apple’s iPhone Smartphones

## Description

I applied different classification models to a test dataset collected from [commoncrawl(WET files for July 2019)](http://commoncrawl.org/the-data/get-started/#WET-Format) to predict the overall sentiment toward Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy using 2 labeled training sets.  
Apart from the goal of conducting sentiment analysis. I used this project as an opportunity to discover __automatic feature engineering tools__ available in Python and R and to:
1.	Compare R __MLR__ and Python __ScikitLearn__ workflows.
2.	Compare different open source free __Automatic Machine Learning Frameworks__( _Automatic Hyperparameter Tuning and Automatic Model selection_ )
