# Sentiment Analysis of Samsung’s Galaxy and Apple’s iPhone Smartphones

## Description

I applied different classification models to a test dataset collected from [commoncrawl(WET files for July 2019)](http://commoncrawl.org/the-data/get-started/#WET-Format) to predict the overall sentiment toward both iPhone and Samsung Galaxy using 2 labeled training sets. I used this project as an opportunity to
1.	Compare R MLR and Python ScikitLearn workflows.
2.	Compare different open source free Automatic Machine Learning Frameworks*
